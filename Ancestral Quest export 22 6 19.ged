2 CONT From Panther Valley Pathways, by Ron Johnson
2 CONT Casedy Family
2 CONT A researcher once stated the Casedy (Cassidy) family seemed to be peopl
2 CONC e who shunned publicity.  Sometimes the only record of them is in scrape
2 CONC s with the law.  I doubt if this is why John Casedy's family line is diff
2 CONC icult to trace.  John lived as a young man in Greene County, not far fro
2 CONC m the Wilson's Creek Battlefield.  It may have been there he first met hi
2 CONC s bride-to-be.  Eliza Ann Edgar's father lived on Wilson's Creek but wa
2 CONC s deceased at the time of the battle.  The Edgar Cemetery where Josiah Je
2 CONC fferson Edgar is buried is within the confines of the present day Nationa
2 CONC l Battlefield.
2 CONT John and Eliza were married on December 18, 1850, in Springfield, Missour
2 CONC i.  They lived at Rolla, Missouri, where their eight children were born
2 CONC .  Four of the children are buried at Rolla, one is buried in the aforeme
2 CONC ntioned Edgar Cemetery.  In 1860 they were living in Greene County; in 18
2 CONC 70, again in Greene County, closer to the Webster County line.  John serv
2 CONC ed in the Union Army, 1862 and 1862, with the Missouri Volunteer Cavalry
2 CONC .  By 1885, John and Eliza were living in Webster County, on the wester
2 CONC n edge, near the present day county road AD and 3461.  That property is s
2 CONC till in possesion of their great-granddaughter, Gertrude Brimmer. ("decea

2 CONT The three children who grew to adulthood were:  William Carl Cassidy, bor
2 CONC n on November 23, 1855 and died in Webster County on May 2, 1935.  Bill n
2 CONC ever married.  James Calvin Cassidy was born on February 25, 1860 and die
2 CONC d at Rogersville on January 22, 1927.  Their youngest child was Stella An
2 CONC n who was born June 24, 1866, at Rolla.  James married Luly Johnson, an
2 CONC d to this union were born five children:  Roy, Winnie, John, Adda and Orb

2 CONT Stella Ann was married to William J. Johnson (see entry under this name)
2 CONC .  William, in his diary, mentions something about Stella's parents:  "Ab
2 CONC out this time I became acquainted with a young lady, the daughter of ver
2 CONC y pious old people, and after some four years of courtship, we were marri
2 CONC ed, January the 17, 1884."  Perhaps the tragedies of losing five of thei
2 CONC r children early in their marriage did something for their piety.  Eliz
2 CONC a had no rosy life, either, before she met John.  Although the details ar
2 CONC e sketchy, she bore a child, Amanda, on July 3, 1846, whose father was Ja
2 CONC mes Harrington.  On January 14, 1847, Eliza married James Harrington, wh
2 CONC o had a family of several children and was about 50 years old.  Eliza wa
2 CONC s about 20.  James died in 1850, and later that year she married John Cas
2 CONC sidy.  Her young half-sister, Stella, must have idolized her "Aunt Mandy"
2 CONC .  In her will, Amanda honored Stella with some of her finest possessions
2 CONC .  She married Nelson Corp, a railroad man.  They lived for many years i
2 CONC n Los Angeles, California.

2 CONT Casedy Family
2 CONT A researcher once stated the Casedy (Cassidy) family seemed to be peopl
2 CONC e who shunned publicity.  Sometimes the only record of them is in scrape
2 CONC s with the law.  I doubt if this is why John Casedy's family line is diff
2 CONC icult to trace.  John lived as a young man in Greene County, not far fro
2 CONC m the Wilson's Creek Battlefield.  It may have been there he first met hi
2 CONC s bride-to-be.  Eliza Ann Edgar's father lived on Wilson's Creek but wa
2 CONC s deceased at the time of the battle.  The Edgar Cemetery where Josiah Je
2 CONC fferson Edgar is buried is within the confines of the present day Nationa
2 CONC l Battlefield.
2 CONT John and Eliza were married on December 18, 1850, in Springfield, Missour
2 CONC i.  They lived at Rolla, Missouri, where their eight children were born
2 CONC .  Four of the children are buried at Rolla, one is buried in the aforeme
2 CONC ntioned Edgar Cemetery.  In 1860 they were living in Greene County; in 18
2 CONC 70, again in Greene County, closer to the Webster County line.  John serv
2 CONC ed in the Union Army, 1862 and 1862, with the Missouri Volunteer Cavalry
2 CONC .  By 1885, John and Eliza were living in Webster County, on the wester
2 CONC n edge, near the present day county road AD and 3461.  That property is s
2 CONC till in possesion of their great-granddaughter, Gertrude Brimmer. ("decea

2 CONT Aaron Singer, the well-known postmaster and Merchant at Reeders, Monroe C
2 CONC ounty, is a man of sound judgement and good executive ability, carrying f
2 CONC orward to successful competition whatever he undertakes. This characteris
2 CONC tic, combined with his undoubted integrity, has brought him prosperity, a
2 CONC nd has given him an honorable position among his fellow men
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Mr. Singer is a representative of one of the honored pioneering familie
2 CONC s of Jackson township. The first of the Singers to come to Monroe count
2 CONC y was his grandfather, Christian Singer, who was born in Germantown, Penn
2 CONC ., in 1777, on the day of the Battle of Germantown, and there grew to man
2 CONC hood. At an early age he came to Monroe county, being one of the first se
2 CONC ttlers in the vicinity of Reeders, Jackson township, where he followed co
2 CONC opering and farming until called from this life, at the age of sixty-thre
2 CONC e years. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Hamilton township, Monroe county, he married a Miss Woodling, a nativ
2 CONC e of the township who died in 183_. The children born to them were Andrew
2 CONC ; Peter; Jacob, father of our subject; Hannah, the wife of John Dailey, o
2 CONC f Pocono township, Monroe county; and Samuel. All are now deceased. For h
2 CONC is second wife Christian Singer married Rachel Van Horn, by whom he had t
2 CONC he following children: Christian; Benjamin; Eunice; Eliza Ann, wife of Re
2 CONC uben Possinger, of Jackson township; Mary, wife of Jacob Frounfelter, o
2 CONC f Tobyhanna Mills; and Amos, the only one now living, who makes his hom
2 CONC e in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jacob Singer was born in Monroe county, August 5, 1805, and was reared i
2 CONC n Jackson township, where he was united in marriage with Miss Elizabeth V
2 CONC an Horn, daughter of John Van Horn. She was born in that township, May 26
2 CONC , 1811, but her parents were natives of Berks county, Penn. After his mar
2 CONC riage Mr. Singer continued to make his home in Jackson township, where h
2 CONC e engaged in business as a farmer and cooper, and also followed lumberin
2 CONC g for some years. In his family were nine children, namely: Josiah, who m
2 CONC arried and died at Tobyhanna Mills; William, a resident of Salem township
2 CONC , Wayne Co., Penn.; Susanna, wife of Elias Kresge, of Newfield, N.Y.; Mar
2 CONC y, widow of Francis Stein, and a resident of Tobyhanna Mills; Almyra, wif
2 CONC e of Sylvester Kresge of Chestnut Hill township, Monroe county; Jacob
2 CONC , a resident of Gouldsboro, Wayne county; Aaron, our subject; Louis, a re
2 CONC sident of Jackson township; and James, of Chestnut Hill township
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Aaron Singer, whose name introduces this review, was born in Jackson town
2 CONC ship, November 6, 1849, and was reared in much the usual manner of farme
2 CONC r lads, assisting in the labors of the fields and attending the common sc
2 CONC hools of the neighborhood. At the age of twenty he began work in the lumb
2 CONC er woods at Tobyhanna Mills, where he was employed for eighteen years, a
2 CONC t the end of that time coming to Jackson township and embarking in farmin
2 CONC g on his own account, on a tract of seventy acres, a part of which is tim
2 CONC ber land; the remainder in under cultivation. In 1890 he became intereste
2 CONC d in general merchandising at Reeders, and now gives the greater part o
2 CONC f his time to that business, in which he has met with gratifying success
2 CONC , receiving a liberal share of the public patronage
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On July 25, 1867, in Chestnut Hill township, Mr. Singer married Miss Lydi
2 CONC a Kresge, a daughter of Michael and Sarah Ann (Shick) Kresge, and to the
2 CONC m were born five children: Francis, who married Clara Sleicker, and live
2 CONC s in Pocono township, Monroe county; Jennie Izelia, who married Thomas Kr
2 CONC esge, and died in 1890, leaving two children, Mamie and Archie; Marilla
2 CONC , who died young; Tilton, at home; and Nettie, wife of Arthur Arnold, o
2 CONC f Stroud township, Monroe county. The wife and mother, who was a consiste
2 CONC nt member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, departed this life May 26, 1
2 CONC 897. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Mr. Singer is also a member of the M.E. Church, and socially he has bee
2 CONC n identified with the Patriotic Order Sons of America for a number of yea
2 CONC rs. Like his father, he is a staunch supporter of the Democratic party an
2 CONC d its principals, and has most capably served his fellow citizens two yea
2 CONC rs as constable and as township auditor for the same length of time. In 1
2 CONC 890 he was appointed postmaster at Reeders, and is still filling that off
2 CONC ice, to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.

2 CONC 40, 441)
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles O BAKER, one of the leading citizens of Greenwood, is engaged i
2 CONC n the real estate business, was born in a log house on the site of the pr
2 CONC esent city of Grand Rapids, Wood Co, WI, Feb. 11, 1847, son of David an
2 CONC d Elizabeth (KLINE) BAKER.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The father, David BAKER, was a native of Orleans County, NY and son of So
2 CONC lomon BAKER, a tradesman of that section and a veteran of the War of 1812
2 CONC -1815, who was of English descent. Solomon had five sons and two daughter
2 CONC s, of whom one of the latter, Mary, married a Mr OTIS and resided in Lans
2 CONC ing, MI.
2 CONT 
2 CONT David BAKER, who married Elizabeth KLINE, a native of Strassburg, Germany
2 CONC , and daughter of George KLINE, left his native place in 1837, soon afte
2 CONC r his marriage, taking the boat at Olean Point and proceeding down the Al
2 CONC legheny and Ohio Rivers to the Mississippi and then up the river to New B
2 CONC oston, IL, where he landed and remained subsequently for two years. At th
2 CONC e end of that time he came to WI, driving with ox team, by way of Galena
2 CONC , Mineral Point and Portage to the site of the present city of Grand Rapi
2 CONC ds. He accompanied by his wife and two children, Lavinia and Jennie; als
2 CONC o by his wife's mother, Elizabeth KLINE, and by other members of the KLIN
2 CONC E family, William, Susan, Karl and Leah. The journey seems to have been p
2 CONC erformed in a leisurely manner, or the roads were bad, or not in evidence
2 CONC , as the trip occupied three months. George KLINE, Mrs David BAKER's brot
2 CONC her, had preceded them and erected the first mill on the site of Grand Ra
2 CONC pids, it being located on the west bank of the river. Some years afterwar
2 CONC ds, in 1849, he joined the rush of gold seekers to California, from whic
2 CONC h expedition he never returned, probably meeting the fate of so many wh
2 CONC o made that dangerous journey. David BAKER, on arriving at Grand Rapids
2 CONC , secured fifty-seven acres of land, situated on what is now the west sid
2 CONC e of that city, and there he built a log cabin. The Kline's got land on t
2 CONC he east side, where the city hall and court house are located, the latte
2 CONC r buildings being erected on land that was owned by George KLINE.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Per River City Memoirs, volume II, George Kline Sr died working on the Me
2 CONC rrill Dam and was brought down the river in a canoe to be buried.

2 CONT Dear son in law George Kline and daughter Elizabeth.

2 CONT With great happiness we received your letter and with heartfelt satisfact

2 CONC e all well and also well off.  We don't have living costs as you think w
2 CONC e have.  A quarter wheat costs six to seven gulden two years ago and no

2 CONC orty gallons) costs nine schilling and one guilder and a very best is tw

2 CONC e belong to that type of people.  Taxes are high and are getting higher a
2 CONC ll the time.

2 CONT (Next line not legible).
2 CONT 
2 CONT We greet you with the same greeting with which you greeted us.  We wish y

1 NOTE Fought in the Indian Wars.  22 Jul 1710, 3 young nieces of James were kid
2 CONC napped by Indians.  He with others including his brothers Samuel and Dani
2 CONC el and his 17 year-old son John tracked the Indians.  He set a trap and k
2 CONC illed two of the Indians but the others got away heading North in their c
2 CONC anoe with the girls.  A week later he returned to Exeter without having c
2 CONC aught up with them.  Girls were the daughters of Catherine and Richard Do
2 CONC lloff named Margaret, Sarah and Abigail.  In 1718 the French said they co
2 CONC uld pay a $75 ransom for each girl and have them returned.  James and Ric
2 CONC hard got the $75 for Abigail but didn't have the money for Margaret so th
2 CONC e NH Court Legislature appropriated the money for her ransom, which the
2 CONC y took to Quebec.  The third daughter Sarah was married to an Indian by t
2 CONC hen.  A few years later Sarah and her Indian husband moved to Exeter bu
2 CONC t the rest of the family found it hard to put up with the Indian husban
2 CONC d so they (along with 5 children) moved away.

2 CONT 
2 CONT     We genealogists are not fiction writers.  We are trained to be meticu
2 CONC lous in our search for ancestral facts.  But sometimes the facts we unear
2 CONC th look like a plot outline for a novel, just crying out to be develope
2 CONC d by the lucky descendants.  I say lucky, because most of us are able t
2 CONC o find only the bare vital statistics of birth, marriage, and death, wit
2 CONC h few or no indications of lifestyle or personality.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     I recently uncovered a story begging to be told.  My client, Priscill
2 CONC a Jaynes, of 8571 Dortha Ct, Santee, California, 92071, who gives her per
2 CONC mission to write the story and hopes to get in touch with fellow descenda
2 CONC nts, asked me to find out as much as I could on her ancestor "Jonas B. Wa
2 CONC ller, born about 1770/71, died 20 February 1815 in Virginia, and was marr
2 CONC ied to Mary 'Polly' Madding in 1793 in Pittsylvania County." I was afrai
2 CONC d that I would find very little on Jonas or his probable father Zacharia
2 CONC h Waller.  I first perused the Waller family file in our society's searc
2 CONC h room vertical files.  Some Waller researchers had contributed a very th
2 CONC orough study of John Waller and his wife Anne.  They had patented land i
2 CONC n Amelia County, VA, as early as 1737.  The land study done by Ann Walle
2 CONC r Reddy, a professional researcher from Richmond, VA, followed John and A
2 CONC nne (her maiden name unknown) from Amelia to Lunenburg County where deed
2 CONC s prove a John Waller, Jr. and likely son Zachariah Waller.  Zachariah wa
2 CONC s of age to be a witness by 1750 and to be married to Dianah ? by 1764, w
2 CONC hen she relinquished her dower.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     John Waller, Jr. was known to have married Lydia Dodson, daughter o
2 CONC f Elisha Dodson and Sarah Averett by 1770.  The Wallers moved on to Halif
2 CONC ax County and, finally, Pittsylvania County.   But there is no will or pr
2 CONC obate record for John Waller, Sr, or for Zachariah.   John, Jr. left a wi
2 CONC ll in Pittsylvania County, dated 28 December 1808, proved 20 Feb. 1809.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     John Waller, Jr.'s wife, Lydia Dodson Waller, had died and John had m
2 CONC arried a second wife, Rebecca.   All of the children were by Lydia, accor
2 CONC ding to the Elias Dodson manuscript, well known to Dodson researchers.  T
2 CONC he children named in the will, were:  daughter Phebe Bolton (Phebe Walle
2 CONC r m Thomas Bolton 14 Jan. 1787); Major Price, formerly husband to my daug
2 CONC hter Sarah Price, dec'd; son Obadiah Waller; daughter Lydia White (wife o
2 CONC f Epaphroditus White); son John Waller; son Joel Waller who had left th
2 CONC e county; and son Pleasant Waller.   By the way, this Pleasant Waller mar
2 CONC ried Apphia Dodson, daughter of Elisha Dodson, in Halifax County 10 Decem
2 CONC ber 1810; and is not to be confused with the son of Zachariah Waller.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     Obviously, there is no Jonas among the heirs.  I began searching th
2 CONC e deeds for Jonas and Zachariah.  Zachariah had many transactions in Pitt
2 CONC sylvania, having first bought land (1766) on Lower Double Creek from Thom
2 CONC as Walters, bordering John Madding's land.  John Waller's land was on Dou
2 CONC ble Creek, as well.   But by 19 Sept. 1770, Zachariah had sold his land t
2 CONC here and moved toward the center of the county to Polly's Branch on Whit
2 CONC e Oak Mountain.  (see "Roger's Ramblings" in this issue for how he locate
2 CONC d Polly's Branch).
2 CONT 
2 CONT     The event which began my paper trail was the purchase of 50 acres i
2 CONC n the White Oak Mountain area by Jonas Waller from Nathaniel Ferguson 1
2 CONC 9 Jan. 1794 (DB 10/103).  This occurred only a year after Jonas married M
2 CONC ary Madding.  In 1808 John Madding married Elizabeth Ferguson, daughter o
2 CONC f Nathaniel Ferguson.  Jonas B. Waller entered into an agreement regardin
2 CONC g a legacy for John's wife, Elizabeth Ferguson Madding through her mothe
2 CONC r Margaret Essex's step-father, William Evans, of Montgomery County, Mary
2 CONC land (DB 16/373).  Jonas B. Waller also acted as Power of Attorney for Jo
2 CONC hn Madding (DB 16/374).  John seems to be of the right age to be a younge
2 CONC r brother to Jonas Waller's wife, Mary, who is usually thought to be th
2 CONC e daughter of William Madding, who provided the surety for her 1793 marri
2 CONC age to Jonas Waller.  In one deed William Madding's wife Tabitha relinqui
2 CONC shed her dower (DB 13/499 19 Oct 1803).  You will notice later that Mar
2 CONC y Madding Waller named a daughter Tabitha, not a common name among the Wa
2 CONC llers or the Maddings.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     My client furnished a death date for Jonas Waller, which unfortunatel
2 CONC y, I proved incorrect by another deed.  Fanny Ferguson on the 3rd day o
2 CONC f February 1815, relinquished all right, title and interest in a tract o
2 CONC f land on White Oak Mountain containing 161 1/2 acres sold by her husban
2 CONC d to Jonas Waller and William Short.   She gave up her dower right for th
2 CONC e heirs of Jonas B. Waller dec'd., to wit:   Polly Waller his wife, Abne
2 CONC r Waller, Fanny Waller, Lucindy Waller, Tabitha L. Waller and Jonas Memor
2 CONC y Waller.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     By this time I had gone to the marriage records and found that Fann
2 CONC y Bridgewater had married Nathaniel Ferguson (23 Nov 1793).  The marriag
2 CONC e bond said that Fanny was a "widow."  I then recalled that there was a m
2 CONC arriage record for Dotia Waller to Thomas Harris or Harness with Jonas B
2 CONC . Waller as her surety.  The written consent for the bond said "I Phane
2 CONC y Ferguson" for "my daughter Dotia Waller."
2 CONT 
2 CONT     But I had not found a Waller marriage to a Bridgewater!  As I puzzle
2 CONC d and pondered, I found still another deed from Nathaniel Ferguson, to Jo
2 CONC nas Bridgewater for 50 acres on White Oak Mountain.  My thoughts went fro
2 CONC m Jonas Bridgewater... to Fanny Bridgewater... to her daughter Doshey Wal
2 CONC ler and then to her probable brother Jonas B. Waller.  Then I knew that J
2 CONC onas Bridgewater Waller must be son of Fanny Bridgewater, brother of Dosh
2 CONC ey.  Thinking of Doshey turned on another light bulb in my brain.  I ha
2 CONC d abstracted a rather unusual deed of gift from Anne Waller, the widow o
2 CONC f John Waller, Sr. and mother of John Waller, Jr. and probably Zacharia
2 CONC h Waller.  This deed of gift (DB 5/42) attested "for the consideration an
2 CONC d lover and good will which I have toward my granddaughter Ann Waller, da
2 CONC ughter of Zachariah Waller, one brindle cow... to my granddaughter Doshe
2 CONC y Waller one brindle heifer.. to my grandson Pleasant Waller one whitefac
2 CONC ed cow.. and to granddaughter Marion Waller... (see later that I believ
2 CONC e that this was misread from the name Mariah Waller).
2 CONT 
2 CONT     This wonderful deed of gift not only proved that Zachariah Waller wa
2 CONC s in fact the son of John and Anne Waller of Amelia, but also that Fann
2 CONC y Bridgewater was the mother of the granddaughter Doshey.  By this tim
2 CONC e I was frantically searching books for an answer.  Finally, after checki
2 CONC ng the Court orders, I struck paydirt.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     I could hardly believe the words I was reading!  In the May Court o
2 CONC f 1778 (OB 4/101) there was an entry against Zachariah Waller for livin
2 CONC g in adultry with Fanny Bridgewater.  They were each fined 1,000 lbs. o
2 CONC f tobacco in cask and costs of court.  Five years later, in January Cour
2 CONC t 1783 Fanny is fined 20 shillings for living in fornication with Zachari
2 CONC ah (OB 4/447).  The fines were turned over to the church wardens to be us
2 CONC ed by the overseers of the poor.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     If I were novelizing this account, I would say that Jonas B. Waller w
2 CONC as the first male child born to Zack and Fanny, and therefore named for h
2 CONC er father, as was the custom of the 1700's.  Doshey must have been born b
2 CONC y 1778 to be named in her grandmother's deed.  I believe that Anne Walle
2 CONC r was in the home of Zachariah and Fanny and that all four of the childre
2 CONC n to whom she gave cattle were Fanny's.   Dianah, Zachariah's wife may ha
2 CONC ve left him for some reason or for the very good reason that her husban
2 CONC d had obviously fallen in love with another woman.  In 1783 Zachariah dee
2 CONC ded two tracts of land on White Oak Mountain, 100 acres each, to John Wal
2 CONC ler and to Pleasant Waller.  There were almost certainly his sons by Fann
2 CONC y.  There was no wife mentioned to relinquish her dower and there had no
2 CONC t been since a 1770 deed.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     The timing of Pleasant's sale of his land coincided with the death o
2 CONC f his father.  There is proof of Zachariah Waller's death in the vestry b
2 CONC ook of Camden Parish, Pittsylvania County, VA.  Joseph Rogers, another re
2 CONC sident of the community of White Oak Mountain, was paid by the vestry boa
2 CONC rd for the coffin and burial of Zachariah Waller during the year 1790.  O
2 CONC n 12 Jan 1790 (DB 9/473) Pleasant Waller and Aggy Waller of Caswell Co.
2 CONC , NC, William Poiner and Charles Lewis jointly sold the 100 acres on Poll
2 CONC y's Branch which had been deeded to Pleasant by his father.  I found als
2 CONC o that Charles Lewis had married Mariah Waller 1 May 1783.  William Poine
2 CONC r may have married a sister of Pleasant, but I can find no record of it
2 CONC .  As we know, after Zachariah had been dead about three years, Fanny mar
2 CONC ried Nathaniel Ferguson and tried to help Polly and Jonas' children afte
2 CONC r his untimely death.  We tend to think that people having children out o
2 CONC f wedlock in the 18th century were universally condemned.   But Anne Wall
2 CONC er's touching gesture toward her grandchildren proved that all people pri
2 CONC ze family and loved ones, despite society's disapproval.  Fanny had enoug
2 CONC h spunk and perhaps luck, too, so that her children did not have to be bo
2 CONC und by the vestry.   Can you blame me for looking at this story as a roma
2 CONC nce?  My apologies and equal space in Lineages to any descendants of Zach
2 CONC ariah and Dianah Waller.

2 CONT Note:
2 CONT "Great Migration Newsletter":
2 CONT ...one of the most prominent among the men who travelled on the Winthro
2 CONC p Fleet in 1630, and one of those in whose name the charter for the Massa
2 CONC chusetts Bay Company had been issued a year earlier. At the time of his m
2 CONC arriage in 1613, Vassall was residing at Eastwood, in the southeastern co
2 CONC rner of Essex. Some sources say that Vassall was from the parish of Rayle
2 CONC igh, which is quite possible, since Rayleigh and Eastwood are adjacent pa
2 CONC rishes. At Rayleigh he may have known Reverend Francis Bright, who was mi
2 CONC nister of that parish for some time, and who came to New England in 1629
2 CONC , only to return to England in 1630, never to return.  Vassall's residenc
2 CONC e in this part of Essex also led to connections which would lead to furth
2 CONC er migration to New England. When Vassall made his second trip to New Eng
2 CONC land in 1635, John Stockbridge and his family sailed on the same vessel
2 CONC , and it is now known that the Stockbridges were from Rayleigh. Vassall a
2 CONC nd Stockbridge soon settled together in Scituate, Massachusetts. Vassal'
2 CONC s wife came from Cold Norton, a short distance north of Eastwood, and per
2 CONC haps through this connection we find that a number of families from tha
2 CONC t vicinity came to New England as well.
2 CONT William Vassal did not, however, reside only in the Rayleigh and Eastwoo
2 CONC d area. On 2 February 1626/7 his son William was baptized at Little Baddo
2 CONC win Essex, and on 20 April 1628 his daughter Anna was baptized there as w
2 CONC ell. Little Baddow was the location of the school run during these year
2 CONC s by Thomas Hooker and John Eliot, and if we may deduce from this that Va
2 CONC ssall was acquainted during these years with these two prominent minister
2 CONC s, then we have a solid connection between the Puritan congregrations i
2 CONC n the southeast of Essex, and the vast web which grew around Hooker and E
2 CONC liot in the Braintree and Nazing areas of Essex.

2 CONC m the received opinions in politics and religion; and used his influenc
2 CONC e for greater charity toward Quakers, etc. The elders expressed their dis
2 CONC approval of their utterances; the church of Plymouth sent him a message b
2 CONC y John Cook, which is recorded in the book of the Second Church, Scituate
2 CONC , dated Apr. 14, 1645; hoping he would desist from proceedings intended
2 CONC , but questioning whether they would commune with him if he went on. He w

2 CONT 
2 CONT Discrepancies:
2 CONT There are numerous discrepancies dealing with William's surname.Researche
2 CONC r Pam Emerson, "Planters of the Commonwealth", and "Great Migration Newsl
2 CONC etter" shows it is Vassall. "Genealogical Dictionary" by Savage, "Compend

2 CONC oneers of Massachusetts" show it is either Vassell or Vassall. "Immigrant
2 CONC s to America Before 1750", by Frederick A. Virkusshows Varsall.
2 CONT The year of William's death is also somewhat in question. Most sources sh
2 CONC ow that William died in either 1655 or 1656 in Barbados. These sources in

2 CONT 
2 CONT     We genealogists are not fiction writers.  We are trained to be meticu
2 CONC lous in our search for ancestral facts.  But sometimes the facts we unear
2 CONC th look like a plot outline for a novel, just crying out to be develope
2 CONC d by the lucky descendants.  I say lucky, because most of us are able t
2 CONC o find only the bare vital statistics of birth, marriage, and death, wit
2 CONC h few or no indications of lifestyle or personality.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     I recently uncovered a story begging to be told.  My client, Priscill
2 CONC a Jaynes, of 8571 Dortha Ct, Santee, California, 92071, who gives her per
2 CONC mission to write the story and hopes to get in touch with fellow descenda
2 CONC nts, asked me to find out as much as I could on her ancestor "Jonas B. Wa
2 CONC ller, born about 1770/71, died 20 February 1815 in Virginia, and was marr
2 CONC ied to Mary 'Polly' Madding in 1793 in Pittsylvania County." I was afrai
2 CONC d that I would find very little on Jonas or his probable father Zacharia
2 CONC h Waller.  I first perused the Waller family file in our society's searc
2 CONC h room vertical files.  Some Waller researchers had contributed a very th
2 CONC orough study of John Waller and his wife Anne.  They had patented land i
2 CONC n Amelia County, VA, as early as 1737.  The land study done by Ann Walle
2 CONC r Reddy, a professional researcher from Richmond, VA, followed John and A
2 CONC nne (her maiden name unknown) from Amelia to Lunenburg County where deed
2 CONC s prove a John Waller, Jr. and likely son Zachariah Waller.  Zachariah wa
2 CONC s of age to be a witness by 1750 and to be married to Dianah ? by 1764, w
2 CONC hen she relinquished her dower.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     John Waller, Jr. was known to have married Lydia Dodson, daughter o
2 CONC f Elisha Dodson and Sarah Averett by 1770.  The Wallers moved on to Halif
2 CONC ax County and, finally, Pittsylvania County.   But there is no will or pr
2 CONC obate record for John Waller, Sr, or for Zachariah.   John, Jr. left a wi
2 CONC ll in Pittsylvania County, dated 28 December 1808, proved 20 Feb. 1809.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     John Waller, Jr.'s wife, Lydia Dodson Waller, had died and John had m
2 CONC arried a second wife, Rebecca.   All of the children were by Lydia, accor
2 CONC ding to the Elias Dodson manuscript, well known to Dodson researchers.  T
2 CONC he children named in the will, were:  daughter Phebe Bolton (Phebe Walle
2 CONC r m Thomas Bolton 14 Jan. 1787); Major Price, formerly husband to my daug
2 CONC hter Sarah Price, dec'd; son Obadiah Waller; daughter Lydia White (wife o
2 CONC f Epaphroditus White); son John Waller; son Joel Waller who had left th
2 CONC e county; and son Pleasant Waller.   By the way, this Pleasant Waller mar
2 CONC ried Apphia Dodson, daughter of Elisha Dodson, in Halifax County 10 Decem
2 CONC ber 1810; and is not to be confused with the son of Zachariah Waller.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     Obviously, there is no Jonas among the heirs.  I began searching th
2 CONC e deeds for Jonas and Zachariah.  Zachariah had many transactions in Pitt
2 CONC sylvania, having first bought land (1766) on Lower Double Creek from Thom
2 CONC as Walters, bordering John Madding's land.  John Waller's land was on Dou
2 CONC ble Creek, as well.   But by 19 Sept. 1770, Zachariah had sold his land t
2 CONC here and moved toward the center of the county to Polly's Branch on Whit
2 CONC e Oak Mountain.  (see "Roger's Ramblings" in this issue for how he locate
2 CONC d Polly's Branch).
2 CONT 
2 CONT     The event which began my paper trail was the purchase of 50 acres i
2 CONC n the White Oak Mountain area by Jonas Waller from Nathaniel Ferguson 1
2 CONC 9 Jan. 1794 (DB 10/103).  This occurred only a year after Jonas married M
2 CONC ary Madding.  In 1808 John Madding married Elizabeth Ferguson, daughter o
2 CONC f Nathaniel Ferguson.  Jonas B. Waller entered into an agreement regardin
2 CONC g a legacy for John's wife, Elizabeth Ferguson Madding through her mothe
2 CONC r Margaret Essex's step-father, William Evans, of Montgomery County, Mary
2 CONC land (DB 16/373).  Jonas B. Waller also acted as Power of Attorney for Jo
2 CONC hn Madding (DB 16/374).  John seems to be of the right age to be a younge
2 CONC r brother to Jonas Waller's wife, Mary, who is usually thought to be th
2 CONC e daughter of William Madding, who provided the surety for her 1793 marri
2 CONC age to Jonas Waller.  In one deed William Madding's wife Tabitha relinqui
2 CONC shed her dower (DB 13/499 19 Oct 1803).  You will notice later that Mar
2 CONC y Madding Waller named a daughter Tabitha, not a common name among the Wa
2 CONC llers or the Maddings.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     My client furnished a death date for Jonas Waller, which unfortunatel
2 CONC y, I proved incorrect by another deed.  Fanny Ferguson on the 3rd day o
2 CONC f February 1815, relinquished all right, title and interest in a tract o
2 CONC f land on White Oak Mountain containing 161 1/2 acres sold by her husban
2 CONC d to Jonas Waller and William Short.   She gave up her dower right for th
2 CONC e heirs of Jonas B. Waller dec'd., to wit:   Polly Waller his wife, Abne
2 CONC r Waller, Fanny Waller, Lucindy Waller, Tabitha L. Waller and Jonas Memor
2 CONC y Waller.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     By this time I had gone to the marriage records and found that Fann
2 CONC y Bridgewater had married Nathaniel Ferguson (23 Nov 1793).  The marriag
2 CONC e bond said that Fanny was a "widow."  I then recalled that there was a m
2 CONC arriage record for Dotia Waller to Thomas Harris or Harness with Jonas B
2 CONC . Waller as her surety.  The written consent for the bond said "I Phane
2 CONC y Ferguson" for "my daughter Dotia Waller."
2 CONT 
2 CONT     But I had not found a Waller marriage to a Bridgewater!  As I puzzle
2 CONC d and pondered, I found still another deed from Nathaniel Ferguson, to Jo
2 CONC nas Bridgewater for 50 acres on White Oak Mountain.  My thoughts went fro
2 CONC m Jonas Bridgewater... to Fanny Bridgewater... to her daughter Doshey Wal
2 CONC ler and then to her probable brother Jonas B. Waller.  Then I knew that J
2 CONC onas Bridgewater Waller must be son of Fanny Bridgewater, brother of Dosh
2 CONC ey.  Thinking of Doshey turned on another light bulb in my brain.  I ha
2 CONC d abstracted a rather unusual deed of gift from Anne Waller, the widow o
2 CONC f John Waller, Sr. and mother of John Waller, Jr. and probably Zacharia
2 CONC h Waller.  This deed of gift (DB 5/42) attested "for the consideration an
2 CONC d lover and good will which I have toward my granddaughter Ann Waller, da
2 CONC ughter of Zachariah Waller, one brindle cow... to my granddaughter Doshe
2 CONC y Waller one brindle heifer.. to my grandson Pleasant Waller one whitefac
2 CONC ed cow.. and to granddaughter Marion Waller... (see later that I believ
2 CONC e that this was misread from the name Mariah Waller).
2 CONT 
2 CONT     This wonderful deed of gift not only proved that Zachariah Waller wa
2 CONC s in fact the son of John and Anne Waller of Amelia, but also that Fann
2 CONC y Bridgewater was the mother of the granddaughter Doshey.  By this tim
2 CONC e I was frantically searching books for an answer.  Finally, after checki
2 CONC ng the Court orders, I struck paydirt.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     I could hardly believe the words I was reading!  In the May Court o
2 CONC f 1778 (OB 4/101) there was an entry against Zachariah Waller for livin
2 CONC g in adultry with Fanny Bridgewater.  They were each fined 1,000 lbs. o
2 CONC f tobacco in cask and costs of court.  Five years later, in January Cour
2 CONC t 1783 Fanny is fined 20 shillings for living in fornication with Zachari
2 CONC ah (OB 4/447).  The fines were turned over to the church wardens to be us
2 CONC ed by the overseers of the poor.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     If I were novelizing this account, I would say that Jonas B. Waller w
2 CONC as the first male child born to Zack and Fanny, and therefore named for h
2 CONC er father, as was the custom of the 1700's.  Doshey must have been born b
2 CONC y 1778 to be named in her grandmother's deed.  I believe that Anne Walle
2 CONC r was in the home of Zachariah and Fanny and that all four of the childre
2 CONC n to whom she gave cattle were Fanny's.   Dianah, Zachariah's wife may ha
2 CONC ve left him for some reason or for the very good reason that her husban
2 CONC d had obviously fallen in love with another woman.  In 1783 Zachariah dee
2 CONC ded two tracts of land on White Oak Mountain, 100 acres each, to John Wal
2 CONC ler and to Pleasant Waller.  There were almost certainly his sons by Fann
2 CONC y.  There was no wife mentioned to relinquish her dower and there had no
2 CONC t been since a 1770 deed.
2 CONT 
2 CONT     The timing of Pleasant's sale of his land coincided with the death o
2 CONC f his father.  There is proof of Zachariah Waller's death in the vestry b
2 CONC ook of Camden Parish, Pittsylvania County, VA.  Joseph Rogers, another re
2 CONC sident of the community of White Oak Mountain, was paid by the vestry boa
2 CONC rd for the coffin and burial of Zachariah Waller during the year 1790.  O
2 CONC n 12 Jan 1790 (DB 9/473) Pleasant Waller and Aggy Waller of Caswell Co.
2 CONC , NC, William Poiner and Charles Lewis jointly sold the 100 acres on Poll
2 CONC y's Branch which had been deeded to Pleasant by his father.  I found als
2 CONC o that Charles Lewis had married Mariah Waller 1 May 1783.  William Poine
2 CONC r may have married a sister of Pleasant, but I can find no record of it
2 CONC .  As we know, after Zachariah had been dead about three years, Fanny mar
2 CONC ried Nathaniel Ferguson and tried to help Polly and Jonas' children afte
2 CONC r his untimely death.  We tend to think that people having children out o
2 CONC f wedlock in the 18th century were universally condemned.   But Anne Wall
2 CONC er's touching gesture toward her grandchildren proved that all people pri
2 CONC ze family and loved ones, despite society's disapproval.  Fanny had enoug
2 CONC h spunk and perhaps luck, too, so that her children did not have to be bo
2 CONC und by the vestry.   Can you blame me for looking at this story as a roma
2 CONC nce?  My apologies and equal space in Lineages to any descendants of Zach
2 CONC ariah and Dianah Waller.

2 CONT William shows up in personal property tax lists for 1787-1791, 1793, 179

2 CONT Baptists, From 1769 to 1885", by J. H. Spencer, 1886.  I will include
2 CONT a section at the end of this note.  It says that the church was
2 CONT constituted on April 1, 1802 by Reverend Isaac Denton and others. In one
2 CONT of his articles in "Cumberland County Kentucky - Yesterday and Today"
2 CONT Dr. Winston W Crouch says the same thing.
2 CONT 
2 CONT    There has been some confusion in the past about Reverend Isaac Denton
2 CONT because there were two of them in the area. The Dentons of Monroe Co
2 CONT and Clay Co (TN) descend from Abraham Denton and Mourning Hogg, who
2 CONT came to the area around 1800 and were early members of the Mill Creek
2 CONT Church. Their son Isaac (born 1774) settled around Brimstone Creek
2 CONT in Clay(Jackson) County and became well-known for his preaching. He is
2 CONT said to have still been preaching as he approached the age of 100.
2 CONT 
2 CONT    The Revernd Isaac Denton of the Clear Fork Baptist Church was a
2 CONT cousin of the other Rev Denton. His parents were Isaac (brother of Abraha
2 CONC m)
2 CONT and Ann Whitson Denton.

2 CONT Abraham DENTON III was born in 1738 in Orange CO, NY. Died in 1828 in Obi
2 CONC on CO, TN. From "The Denton Family" by David H. Templin, printed in the S
2 CONC mokey Mountain Historical Newsletter, Spring 1983: "Abraham Denton move
2 CONC d to the Watauga settlements by 1775, and the family was forced back int
2 CONC o Virginia by the Cherokee invasion during the summer of 1776. Abraham wa
2 CONC s active in the affairs of Washington and Greene Counties. Abraham appare
2 CONC ntly was living in the section of Washington County which was formed int
2 CONC o Greene County. August 23, 1784, Abraham was a delegate from Greene Coun
2 CONC ty to the convention held in Jonesboro and which led to the formation o
2 CONC f the State of Franklin. Abraham was one of five grantees to 150 acres ly
2 CONC ing in the Fork of Big Pigeon and French Broad River. This grant was issu
2 CONC ed by North Carolina June 11, 1788. The land is located in what is now Co
2 CONC cke County, Tennessee. The first church established in what is now Cock
2 CONC e County, Tennessee was the Big Pigeon Baptist Church. Among the charte
2 CONC r members is found Mourning Denton. Abraham seems to have disappeared fro
2 CONC m East Tennessee by the time Tennessee became a state. It is said that h
2 CONC e appears in White County, Tennessee about 1809 and in Perry county in 18
2 CONC 21. In her book, Edythe Whitely lists the children of Abraham and Mournin
2 CONC g Denton. The list seems to have been prepared from letters and other pap
2 CONC ers collected from John S. Denton. One letter cited in her book was fro
2 CONC m Holland Denton, grandson of Abraham and Mourning."
2 CONT Abraham apparently fought with the North Carolina line in the Revolutiona
2 CONC ry War after he moved to the Yadkin river region.
2 CONT Abraham's movements: 1766 in NC; 1774 in Rowan CO, NC; 1783 in Burke CO

2 CONT 
2 CONT Fuller story on Abraham Denton
2 CONT Capt. Abraham II DENTON was born in 1700 in Hemstead, NY. Baptized on 1
2 CONC 2 Aug 1774. Died in 1774 in Shenandoah CO, VA. His will was presented Aug
2 CONC ust 12, 1774. He died and is buried at Tom's Brook Plantation in Shenando
2 CONC ah CO, VA.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Abraham was a Captain in the French and Indian War in the Provincial Arm
2 CONC y of 1766.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Abraham, according to sources in Orange CO, NY, had some problems with lo
2 CONC cal law and soon after left the county for a new home in the Shenandoah C
2 CONC ounty of Virginia. This was in 1729 or 1730. Thus started the move westwa
2 CONC rd, for his sons each moved in different directions into the frontier.
2 CONT 
2 CONT From The Tennessee Valley Historical Review: "Abraham Denton, Junior, bec
2 CONC ame involved with the law in New York in about 1729-30. He, along with so
2 CONC me close relatives, left that state and headed for Virginia, crossing th
2 CONC e eastern part of Pennsylvania and the northwestern part of Maryland. I
2 CONC n the Valley of Virginia, then Orange County (later Augusta County) and t
2 CONC he upper Virginia Valley, (Frederick, later Dunmore, and still later Shen
2 CONC andoah County) we find Abraham and his family. Also about the same time
2 CONC , Jonas Denton and others had reached the Virginia country. Samuel, Rober
2 CONC t, James and John Denton begin to appear in the same general locality. Th
2 CONC e deeds in Frederick County clearly prove that the Dentons were there a
2 CONC s early as 1755 and became prominent citizens."
2 CONT 
2 CONT Abraham left a deed dated August 12, 1774 which was signed by Mary Dento
2 CONC n Little. Dorothy Clock (Clark) Elizabeth Smith and Mary Pareson (Pearson
2 CONC ) made their marks.
2 CONT 
2 CONT He married Mary O'DELL in 1725 in Orange CO, NY. Mary O'DELL was born i
2 CONC n 1702 in Woodstock, VA.Abraham's will was written August 12, 1774 and pr
2 CONC obated September 27, 1774 in Shenandoah CO, VA. Died in 1779 in Shenandoa
2 CONC h, VA. Will book A, page 200, Woodstock Shenandoah CO, VA pgs. 228-229. A
2 CONC dministration and inventory of estate and apportionment. Heirs: Elizabet
2 CONC h Smith, Hannah Smith and Daridea Clock (Clark). These were probably Mary
2 CONC 's sisters who took care of her in her old age as her children had alread
2 CONC y moved on by the time her husband died.

2 CONT William Clough was born on May 19, 1734 at Salem, New Hampshire, the so
2 CONC n of Isaac Clough and Sarah (Swain) Clough.
2 CONT 
2 CONT His grave was initially placed on Find a Grave from information found i
2 CONC n "Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots."
2 CONT 
2 CONT Through the years, there have been many knowledgeable people on the Cloug
2 CONC h family. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, many of them were member
2 CONC s of the John Clough Genealogical Society. Walter Cluff, who died on Apri
2 CONC l 26, 1943, was credited as being the Founder of and was the first Presid
2 CONC ent of the Society. In 1943, the Society published the book entitled, "TH
2 CONC E STORY OF THE FAMILY OF JOHN CLOUGH, OF SALISBURY, MASSACHUSETTS." The
2 CONC n in 1952, the book entitled, "THE GENEALOGY OF THE DESCENDANTS OF JOHN C
2 CONC LOUGH, OF SALISBUTY, MASSACHUSETTS was published. The following short bio
2 CONC graphy comes from the 2nd book, page 127 & 128. Anyone with an interest i
2 CONC n the Clough family history needs to find copies of these books.

2 CONC . August 21, 1798 at Lyman, N.H., aged 64 yrs., 4 mo. 2 days. Mar. *_____
2 CONC _____ Mary Austin; Abigail ______________. He served in the French and In
2 CONC dian War for three years, was captured, and carried to France and confine
2 CONC d in the Bastille for a year. He returned with the other released prisone
2 CONC rs to New York, where his brother, Wyman, found him and returned with hi
2 CONC m to their home in Salem, N.H. He is first mentioned in tax lists in 175
2 CONC 9 and was deeded land by his father in 1760. He was a town constable in 1
2 CONC 767, surveyor of highways in 1777 in which year he also paid a soldier'
2 CONC s tax for Continental soldiers. He entered the Revolution without enlistm
2 CONC ent and was at the Battle of Bunker Hill. He lived near the other Clough
2 CONC s in Salem, but further to the west near Policy Brook where he is said t
2 CONC o have operated a grist mill. He left Salem about 1785 and went to Lyman
2 CONC , N.H., where he located on Clough Hill near the Great Rock. He evidentl
2 CONC y had a grist mill here because he and another Clough found three or fou
2 CONC r Indians prowling around the mill one day and promptly dispatched them w
2 CONC ith blows of an iron pipe to happier hunting grounds. He often found it c
2 CONC onvenient to send his boys to drive the bears out of the wheat. He petiti
2 CONC oned the state of New Hampshire for relief in 1786. Many of his descendan
2 CONC ts became prominent in northern New Hampshire. He is buried in the Cemete
2 CONC ry on Parker Hill in Lyman, N.H. and his grave is marked by a stone wit
2 CONC h the initials W. C.

2 CONT I must make a comment here. There are nearly thirty years separating Will
2 CONC iam and Darius. Though all of these children are listed as the children o
2 CONC f William and Mary, it is also noted that William was married twice. Will
2 CONC iam's first wife was Mary Austin and she almost certainly died before 176
2 CONC 2. They are believed by many to have had just two children, a daughter, w
2 CONC ho died in infancy and the oldest child, William. If this is true, then a
2 CONC ll of the children listed above, except for William, were from his 2nd ma
2 CONC rriage to Abigail Bailey, which occurred on November 30, 1762 in ________
2 CONC __, __________. On the internet, dates of birth for Abigail Bailey, who i
2 CONC s believed to have been the daughter of Edward Bailey and Elizabeth (Burb
2 CONC ank) Bailey, range from 1742 to January 16, 1748/49. Abigail is believe
2 CONC d to have died c. June 12, 1813 and hers is probably one of the many ston
2 CONC es now missing from the Parker Hill Cemetery.
2 CONT Twelve children were born to this union, all being recorded in Salem, Ne
2 CONC w Hampshire town records, births starting a year after the marriage wit
2 CONC h Zerniah, who died young, and ending with Darius in June 1783.
2 CONT 
2 CONT New Hampshire death records gives William's death date as 21 Aug 1798 an
2 CONC d age at death as 4 days, 4 months, 64 years.  That would mean his birt
2 CONC h date was 17 Apr 1734.

2 CONT 1. John Clough of Salisbury, Massachusetts, [The John Clough Genealogica
2 CONC l Society, Inc., 1952], pp. 25-32:
2 CONT John Clough was an Englishman who arrived in Charlestown, Massachusetts i
2 CONC n midsummer of 1635 on the ship "Elizabeth." John Clough was a Puritan, y
2 CONC et he was even more of a dissenter than the Pilgrims or the puritan of th
2 CONC e Bay colony; John Clough was a Presbyterian, a member of a religious sec
2 CONC t that was forbidden to assemble in England by order of the King. He sett
2 CONC led in Ipswich, Massachusetts and then later in Salisbury, Massachusetts
2 CONC . He was not a poor man as he paid for his passage to New England which w
2 CONC as not less than twenty-five pounds. He paid fifty pounds to become a pro
2 CONC prietor of Salisbury, Massachusetts. He received his share of upland in t
2 CONC he second division which demanded that possess at least another 150 pound
2 CONC s. He was soon joining Robert Pike, the most wealthy business man and Hen
2 CONC ry True in the enterprise of building a vessel in Boston probably for th
2 CONC e coasting trade which was a means of accumulating an income rapidly.
2 CONT He was made a freeman in 1640. He was a surveyor of highways in 1640, cho
2 CONC sen to order affairs of Salisbury, February 1, 1664 and was constable, Ju
2 CONC ne 3, 1693. He is mentioned numerous times in records of land transaction
2 CONC s and depositions. He was accepted into the church of Salisbury in 1641.
2 CONT Between 1656 and 1660, John moved to Salisbury Plains where he purchase
2 CONC d extensive tracts of land from time to time, and erected his homestead
2 CONC . His rights as a commoner in the divisions of upland probably permitte
2 CONC d him to receive shares of land which later became Kingston, New Hampshir
2 CONC e. Before his death, John acquired hundreds of acres of land in Salisbury

1 NOTE A BRIEF SKETCH OF THE FUR TRADE AND FUR TRADERS AMONG THE OJIBWAYS FROM T
2 CONC HE FORMATION OF THE NORTHWEST COMPANY IN 1787 TO 1834.
2 CONT page 384 
2 CONT These items respecting the fur trade are here introduced to give the read
2 CONC er an idea of the importance of the trade amongst the Ojibways, and to in
2 CONC troduce the names of the principal traders who, at this time, were remain
2 CONC ing in the country. The Astor Fur Company followed the example of the Nor
2 CONC thwest Company in hiring as traders, men whom they found already in the c
2 CONC ountry, holding influential positions among the Ojibways, and in some cas
2 CONC es connected with them by marriage. Some of these men had traded in conne
2 CONC ction with the old Northwest Company, as William Morrison, Cotte, Roussai
2 CONC n, Corbin, and others,while others of more recent date had traded as oppo
2 CONC sition traders, and distinguished themselves by their success. Among thes
2 CONC e may be mentioned Wm. A. Aitkin, Esq., who first came into the Chippewa
2 CONC y country about 1815, a mere boy, and as a servant for a trader named Joh
2 CONC n Drew. Intermarrying into an influential Indian family, he was soon enab
2 CONC led to trade on his own account, and he gradually increased his busines
2 CONC s till, in 1831, he takes charge of 'the important department of Fond d
2 CONC u Lee, on halves, with John Jacob Astor. Mr. Aitkin's name is linked wit
2 CONC h the history of the Upper Mississippi Ojibways for the last half century
2 CONC . He was one of the old pioneers of the northwest. He died[p.384] in th
2 CONC e fall of the year 1851, and lies buried at Aitkinsville (Swan River), o
2 CONC n the banks of the Upper Mississippi.
2 CONT 
2 CONT 6 John Drew was a well-known merchant of Mackinac, who for many years wa
2 CONC s in the Indian trade. In 1836 he accompanied a number of chiefs to Washi
2 CONC ngton, where he was witness to a treaty.-- E

2 CONC s Co., 4th Regt., Col. John Durkee, Continental Line, discharged 1 Jan. 1
2 CONC 778 [Conn. Men in the Revolution, p. 187]. A William Hazen is also on a l
2 CONC ist of Revolutionary soldiers enlisted from Woodbury, Conn. [One of thes
2 CONC e records may apply to William son of Jacob, through no tradition has com
2 CONC e to us of his service.
2 CONT This is certainly the William Hazen who served as a Private in Capt. Will
2 CONC iam Hutchins' Co., Col. Herrick's Regt. of Vermont Militia, eight days fr
2 CONC om 11 Oct. 1780; also as Corporal in Capt. William Hutchins' Co. in the B

2 CONC o 3 June, and from 1 July to 19 Nov. 1781. [Vt. Revolutionary Rolls, pp
2 CONC . 214, 397, 567.]
2 CONT About 1783, together with Alexander Gordon and Lamberton Allen, he commen
2 CONC ced the settlement of "The Two Heres," locating within the limits of th
2 CONC e present town of Grand Isle, Vermont. After the division of the Two Hero
2 CONC es, he was elected lister at the first town meeting of South Hero, 1 Mar
2 CONC . 1789; selectman in 1790; highway surveyor in 1794; and Representative i
2 CONC n the legislature, 1795-6.
2 CONT "William Hazen of South Her, County of Chittenden," sold land in Middleto
2 CONC wn, Vt., 21 Feb 1789 (Deed witnessed by Alexander Gordon and John Knight)
2 CONC , and he sold considerable land in South Hero, 1790-1800. His last deed t
2 CONC here seems to be one dated 25 Nov. 1801, by which he sold to Ephriam Sawy
2 CONC er, Jr., of Middle Hero, for $2,000., first division lot no 193, origina
2 CONC l right of John Folsom [possibly his father-in-law]. The Census of 1800 s
2 CONC hows in the family of William Hazen of Middle Hero [separated as a town f
2 CONC rom South Hero in 1798, name changed to Grand Isle in 1800], three male
2 CONC s and four females under sixteen. This agrees exactly with the statemen
2 CONC t made by his granddaughter, Mrs. Anna (Perry) Carlton, in 1897. She als
2 CONC o asserted that William remained in Grand Isle until his death, though He
2 CONC menway's Vermont Gazetter states that he probably removed to some other p
2 CONC lace about 1800, and there is no record of the settlement of his estate i
2 CONC n Grand Isle County. His father's will proves that he died before 12 Oct
2 CONC . 1803. A recent list (without authority) gives him a place among Revolut
2 CONC ionary soldiers buried in Vermont.

2 CONC ., in 1777, on the day of the Battle of Germantown, and there grew to man
2 CONC hood. At an early age he came to Monroe county, being one of the first se

2 CONC opering and farming until called from this life, at the age of sixty-thre
2 CONC e years. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Hamilton township, Monroe county, he married a Miss Woodling, a nativ

2 CONC f Tobyhanna Mills; and Amos, the only one now living, who makes his hom
2 CONC e in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jacob Singer was born in Monroe county, August 5, 1805, and was reared i
2 CONC n Jackson township, where he was united in marriage with Miss Elizabeth V
2 CONC an Horn, daughter of John Van Horn. She was born in that township, May 26
2 CONC , 1811, but her parents were natives of Berks county, Penn. After his mar
2 CONC riage Mr. Singer continued to make his home in Jackson township, where h
2 CONC e engaged in business as a farmer and cooper, and also followed lumberin

2 CONC , Wayne Co., Penn.; Susanna, wife of Elias Kresge, of Newfield, N.Y.; Mar

2 CONT Aaron Singer, whose name introduces this review, was born in Jackson town
2 CONC ship, November 6, 1849, and was reared in much the usual manner of farme
2 CONC r lads, assisting in the labors of the fields and attending the common sc
2 CONC hools of the neighborhood. At the age of twenty he began work in the lumb
2 CONC er woods at Tobyhanna Mills, where he was employed for eighteen years, a
2 CONC t the end of that time coming to Jackson township and embarking in farmin
2 CONC g on his own account, on a tract of seventy acres, a part of which is tim
2 CONC ber land; the remainder in under cultivation. In 1890 he became intereste
2 CONC d in general merchandising at Reeders, and now gives the greater part o
2 CONC f his time to that business, in which he has met with gratifying success
2 CONC , receiving a liberal share of the public patronage
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On July 25, 1867, in Chestnut Hill township, Mr. Singer married Miss Lydi
2 CONC a Kresge, a daughter of Michael and Sarah Ann (Shick) Kresge, and to the
2 CONC m were born five children: Francis, who married Clara Sleicker, and live
2 CONC s in Pocono township, Monroe county; Jennie Izelia, who married Thomas Kr
2 CONC esge, and died in 1890, leaving two children, Mamie and Archie; Marilla
2 CONC , who died young; Tilton, at home; and Nettie, wife of Arthur Arnold, o
2 CONC f Stroud township, Monroe county. The wife and mother, who was a consiste
2 CONC nt member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, departed this life May 26, 1
2 CONC 897. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Mr. Singer is also a member of the M.E. Church, and socially he has bee
2 CONC n identified with the Patriotic Order Sons of America for a number of yea
2 CONC rs. Like his father, he is a staunch supporter of the Democratic party an
2 CONC d its principals, and has most capably served his fellow citizens two yea
2 CONC rs as constable and as township auditor for the same length of time. In 1
2 CONC 890 he was appointed postmaster at Reeders, and is still filling that off
2 CONC ice, to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.

1 NOTE Peter Browne
2 CONT BAPTISM:  26 January 1594/5 at Dorking, co. Surrey, England, son of Willi
2 CONC am Browne.
2 CONT FIRST MARRIAGE:  Mrs. Martha Ford, widow, by about 1626, at Plymouth.
2 CONT SECOND MARRIAGE:  Mary, by about 1631, at Plymouth.
2 CONT CHILDREN (by Martha):  Mary, Priscilla
2 CONT CHILDREN (by Mary): Rebecca, and a child whose name has not been discover
2 CONC ed.
2 CONT DEATH:  1633, probably in the autumn when a sickness was spreading throug
2 CONC h Plymouth.
2 CONT Peter Browne's English origins were discovered in 2004, when I publishe
2 CONC d the results of my research into his origins in The American Genealogist
2 CONC , 79(July 2004):161-178. Peter Browne was baptized in Dorking, co. Surrey
2 CONC , England on 26 January 1594/5, the son of William Browne. The Browne fam
2 CONC ily appears to have had several associations with the Mullins family of D
2 CONC orking, who also came on the Mayflower. Peter Browne's brother John Brown
2 CONC e came to Plymouth Colony about 1632 and settled in Duxbury, the next tow
2 CONC n just to the north of Plymouth. John Browne was baptized in Dorking on 2
2 CONC 9 June 1600.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On 12 January 1621, Peter Browne and John Goodman had been cutting thatc
2 CONC h for house roofing all morning. They ate some meat and went for a shor
2 CONC t walk to refresh themselves, when their two dogs (an English mastiff an
2 CONC d a English spaniel) spied a great deer and gave chance. Peter and John f
2 CONC ollowed and quickly got lost. They wandered around the entire afternoon i
2 CONC n the rain, and spent the night in a tree (and pacing back and forth unde
2 CONC r it) fearing that they had heard lions roaring in the woods. The next da
2 CONC y they made their way up a hill, spotted the Bay, reoriented themselves
2 CONC , and made it back home to an extremely worried Colony that had already s
2 CONC ent out two exploring parties in an attempt to find them.

2 CONT This oak and birch tankard is believed to have belonged to Mayflower pass
2 CONC enger Peter Browne.  It is on display at the Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymo
2 CONC uth. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In a partial list of the house locations of the Pilgrims made out in 1620
2 CONC , John Goodman and Peter Browne appear to have been neighbors on the sout
2 CONC h side of the Street and the ocean side of the Highway. Peter Browne wa
2 CONC s apparently still living there during the 1623 Division of Land. By abou
2 CONC t 1626, he married Martha Ford, who arrived as one of the only female pas
2 CONC sengers on the ship Fortune in 1621. She gave birth almost immediately af
2 CONC ter arriving, but husband Ford apparently died during the voyage or short
2 CONC ly after arrival. In the 1627 Division of Cattle he, his wife Martha (For
2 CONC d), his daughter Mary Browne, and his stepchildren John and Martha Ford w
2 CONC ere included with the Samuel Fuller and Anthony Anable families. Abou
2 CONC t a year later, Peter and Martha would have daughter Priscilla (perhaps n
2 CONC amed after Mayflower passenger Priscilla Mullins who was also from Dorkin
2 CONC g), but wife Martha would die shortly thereafter. Peter remarried to a wo
2 CONC man named Mary, whose maiden name has not been discovered. With her, he h
2 CONC ad a daughter Rebecca born about 1631, and another child who was born abo
2 CONC ut 1633 and died before reaching adulthood (the name of this child has no
2 CONC t been discovered).
2 CONT 
2 CONT Peter Browne died in 1633, probably during the general sickness that occu
2 CONC rred that autumn and also killed neighbor Samuel Fuller, Mayflower passen
2 CONC ger Francis Eaton, and several others in Plymouth. His estate inventory
2 CONC , taken 10 October 1633, shows that he owned 130 bushels of corn, six mel
2 CONC ch goats, one cow, eight sheep, and a number of pigs, among other things
2 CONC .  Peter Browne and his brothers were all weavers, which explains why h
2 CONC e had more sheep than anyone else in Plymouth at the time.

1 NOTE From Jehu Burr's entry on Findagrave.com
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jehu Burr was born in England and was the son of Jonathan Burr & Esther S
2 CONC tedman. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT He emigrated in 1630 in the Winthrop Fleet and on his arrival in America
2 CONC , he settled in Roxbury, Massachusetts where he was made a freeman on 1
2 CONC 8 May 1631. In 1633 he served on a committee with William Pynchon, the Co
2 CONC lony Treasurer. In 1636 he went with Pynchon to Springfield and was appoi
2 CONC nted Collector for the Connecticut Colony. He was Deputy for Springfiel
2 CONC d to the Connecticut Legislature in April 1638 and September 1641. Soon a
2 CONC fter 1641 he removed to Fairfield, becoming a Deputy to the Connecticut L
2 CONC egislature for Fairfield in September 1645 and April 1646
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT By trade he was a carpenter.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jehu married Miss Elizabeth Cable and they had ten children. All of thes
2 CONC e children married and had families. Among the descendants one finds man
2 CONC y individuals who were leaders in military, political, and human affairs
2 CONC . Their monuments can be found in the Old Burying Ground of Fairfield an
2 CONC d other cemeteries in surrounding towns
2 CONC . 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Jehu Burr was the founder of the Fairfield branch. The Burr family is fea
2 CONC tured in The Families of Old Fairfield by Donald Lines Jacobus
2 CONC . 
2 CONT He has many prominent descendants including Govenor and Vice President Aa
2 CONC ron Burr. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As the founder of an important and honored family, it would be interestin
2 CONC g to know the circumstances of his death, and his place of burial. Carefu
2 CONC l search, however, fails to discover either. We know that he died some ti
2 CONC me in 1672, from an entry on p.238, vol. i.,Fair. Records, Jan. 12, 1673
2 CONC , which mentions John Burr as receiving twenty-seven acres of land by wil
2 CONC l of his father.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Headstones of early settlers were of rude construction and quarried by th
2 CONC e relatives of the deceased before there were any regular stone cutters i
2 CONC n the area. They usually only had the initials of the person and the dat
2 CONC e of their death. Very few remain and are so eroded by time and weather t
2 CONC o be almost illegible. No headstone can be found or Jehu Burr.

1 TEXT A Tribute to the Sullivans.  When Alice Goodfellow first met Clifford Sul
2 CONC livan at the Bullerville Dance Hall in Marblemount, little did anyone gue
2 CONC ss that they would be together for 50 plus years.  On their first date, C
2 CONC liff fell asleep -- and Alice was not impressed.  But, he continued to co
2 CONC urt her, and somewhere along the way she became impressed.  On June 9, 19
2 CONC 39, they were married in Anacortes at Sacred Heart Church.  Their weddin
2 CONC g reception took place at the same dance hall where they first met.  In 1
2 CONC 940, Patricia Jean was born, followed in 1941 by Clifford Leonard Jr.  I
2 CONC n 1942 came Rodney Lee, and in 1945 Judith Ann made the picture complete
2 CONC .  Over the years, there have been many moves, and the family has grown w
2 CONC ith grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  There have been good times an
2 CONC d bad, laughter and tears, joy and sorrow.  Through it all Alice and Clif
2 CONC f's love has survived, and it is for this that we honor them.  And to al
2 CONC l of the friends and family who took time out of their busy lives today t
2 CONC o help us celebrate, we thank you.  To Mom and Dad, we love you, and wis
2 CONC h you many more years together.  Signed:  Rod, Cliff, Pat, Judi.

2 CONT He came to Onawa, Iowa, in 1896 and the following year was married to Lau
2 CONC ra Dailes.  To this union were born two children, Ruby, Mrs. Ralph Sparks
2 CONC , Mankota, Minnesota, and Mrs. Charles Pratt of Slonn, Iowa.  Mrs. Sulliv
2 CONC an died November 18, 1905.
2 CONT Mr. Sullivan came to Whiting about 1911 and operated a merchantile busine
2 CONC ss for a number of years, then farmed west of town until he retired.  H
2 CONC e was married August 23, 1919, to Miss Birdie Backer at Whiting, Iowa.

2 CONC , Prospect Lodge 531 at Whiting.  He was devoted to these several organiz
2 CONC ations, a faithful member and exemplified the principles and teachings th
2 CONC ereof.
2 CONT Mr. Sullivan had been poorly for about two years and the past few month
2 CONC s had failed rapidly.  He died in a hospital at Sioux City early Saturda
2 CONC y morning, May 25, 1946.  He recently passed his 77th birthday.
2 CONT He is survived by his wife of 27 years, the two daughters, a brother, Mil

2 CONC , Colorado, and nine grandchildren, Roland and Howard Sparks, Charlot
2 CONC t L George C, Edward W, Audrey P, Glen C, Patsy A and Jerry R Pratt.
2 CONT Such in brief is the tale of where he lived and how he occupied himself
2 CONC .  But no written records, however long, could be more than a rude charco
2 CONC al sketch of any man's life.  Mr. Sullivan had lived in and near Whitin
2 CONC g for more than a third of a century.  his life was an open book before h
2 CONC is fellow men who saw him come and go and who welcomed him into their hom
2 CONC es and associations.  He was a kindly and amiable man, courteous and thou
2 CONC ghtful, a good companion, and a devoted friend.  He was as keen as he wa
2 CONC s kindly, open hearted and fair minded.  No such man could walk the stree
2 CONC ts of a village for so many years without leaving a deep impress upon oth
2 CONC ers and becoming a stabilizing factor in the community life.  His life ha
2 CONC d been a blessing to many.  He was greatly interested in the affairs of s
2 CONC tate and the deeper issues of personal life.  He expressed himself clearl
2 CONC y and without reservation.  To know him well was to admire his sincerity
2 CONC , generosity and friendliness.  He was a man whom no one could know witho

2 CONC n more than one (1) year prior to the commencement of this suit.  II.  Th

2 CONC .  That, heretofore and for more than one (1) year last past, the defenda
2 CONC nt has developed towards plaintiff a quarrelsome and faultfinding disposi
2 CONC tion, which necessitated the plaintiff separating from the defendent; tha
2 CONC t, during the month of ___, 1922, while this plaintiff was attending a so

2 CONC nd boisterous manner and in the presence of said friends, accused this pl
2 CONC aintiff of improper and immoral conduct with another man, said man bein

2 CONC d time.  IV.  That plaintiff is self-supporting and is able and willing t
2 CONC o care, nurture and educate said child.  Q. Mrs. Dennis, when were you ma
2 CONC rried to Mr. Dennis?  A. In 1918 in Portland.  Q. Have you resided here e
2 CONC ver since?  A. Yes, we have had our home here, we have been out of the ci
2 CONC ty a couple of times, but we have lived here.  Q. What was the result o
2 CONC f your marriage as far as children were concerned?  A. I have a little ba
2 CONC by girl two years old, she is 2 the 6th of December.  Q. With whom is she
2 CONC ?  A. She is with me.  Q. With whom do you reside?  A. I reside with myse
2 CONC lf and the baby.  Q. Does your mother reside in the city?  A. Yes.  Q. An
2 CONC d what are you doing now?  A. I work in the Portland Boiler Works, I am t
2 CONC he bookkeeper there.  Q. Who takes care of the child?  A. There is a lad
2 CONC y that lives underneath me in the same building that keeps her when I a
2 CONC m in the office and I have her the rest of the time.  Q. Are you able t
2 CONC o support this child?  A. Yes.  Q. And you desire to have the care and cu
2 CONC stody of the child given to you?  A. Most assuredly I do.  Q. Now what ha
2 CONC s been the treatment of Mr. Dennis toward you?  A. We have had all kind
2 CONC s of trouble and it has been so mixed up and so varied that I would hav
2 CONC e to go into a lot of detailed information.  He is very very quarrelsome
2 CONC , he is 20 years older than I am and he has always been very quarrelsom
2 CONC e and very jealous of me, and we have had lots and lots of trouble ove
2 CONC r a good many things, jealousy and his disposition.  He is just differen
2 CONC t than the ordinary human being, he is not an ordinary citizen he don't w
2 CONC ant to pay his bills, he don't want to live up to the ordinary standard
2 CONC s of decent business livlihood.  Q. What language does he use toward yo
2 CONC u when he is angry with you?  A. Well, I don't believe you would want t
2 CONC o hear it, he is very vulgar and he goes into these jealous spasms, the
2 CONC y come on just like that, -- over nothing, and he gets ugly and you can'
2 CONC t stay in the house with him.  One time we had a little house, and we ha
2 CONC d some trouble, and he told me and he told my father that he would burn t
2 CONC hat house down before he would let me have it, and I got out a restrainin
2 CONC g order against him, I was afraid that he would do that, and we made up o
2 CONC ur trouble and tried it again, but it got so unbearable that I could no
2 CONC t live with him any longer.  Then we sold that place and the check was ma
2 CONC de to me, and when we cashed the check he demanded half the money.  Q. Re
2 CONC cite the incident that happened at a social gathering?  A. I went over t
2 CONC o the East Side Woodmen Hall to dance one night, and I had my baby with m
2 CONC e, and I was at this dance, I had been over there many times and I know t
2 CONC wo-thirds of the people that go there, and Mr. Dennis was there, and I wa
2 CONC s dancing with a gentleman, and he called me off the dance floor when I w
2 CONC as dancing, and I walked over to him, and he wanted to know who this ma
2 CONC n was, and why I was talking to him, and he said that I had no business t
2 CONC o talk with the man when I was dancing with him, and I knew he was in a f
2 CONC rantic rage, and I started out in the hall and he came out in the hall, a
2 CONC nd he says, "I am going to beat that guy up right now".  And I says "I ca
2 CONC nnot help what you are going to do, I am going home" and I put on my thin
2 CONC gs and the baby's, and pretty soon I saw Mr. Dennis and this gentleman st
2 CONC art out the door, and two or three other gentleman followed them out, an
2 CONC d just about as quick Mr. Dennis came back in the house and says "Well, t
2 CONC his man says he never had anything to do with you, so you can go on and d
2 CONC ance with him."  And I says "I am going home" and I went home with my bab
2 CONC y and this woman.  Q.  And have you lived with him since?  A. No, I haven
2 CONC 't, and I am not going to live with him any more.  I don't want any mor
2 CONC e of that man.  Never since February has this man given me a bootle of mi
2 CONC le, neither have I asked for it, and he doesn't come to see the baby, an
2 CONC d he don't show any interest in her, and in fact he lives at this Lamb'
2 CONC s Club on 6th Street and plays cards in there morning, noon and night.  Q
2 CONC . Have you this gentleman here that he insulted?  A. Yes.  Mr. Van Duze
2 CONC r is sworn.  Q. You know Mr. Dennis?  A. Yes.  Q. Relate the circumstanc
2 CONC e over in the Woodmen Hall, did you hear that circumstance related by Mrs
2 CONC . Dennis? A. Yes.  Q. Was that substantially true?  A. Yes.  Q. And was y
2 CONC our conduct with Mrs. Dennis such as to cause any criticism at all?  A
2 CONC . I don't think so.  Q. Mr. Dennis at that time really acted like he wa
2 CONC s a crazy man?  A. Why, I don't know, they came in the hall, and I know M
2 CONC rs. Dennis and I know Mr. Dennis, and I walked over and spoke to them, an
2 CONC d she gave me an introduction to a lady friend, and I danced with the lad
2 CONC y friend, and I went back and took Mrs. Dennis out and danced half of th
2 CONC e fox trot and she quit me and went over to Mr. Dennis, and I went to g
2 CONC o to another lady, and he come over and he said "I want to speak to yo
2 CONC u a half a minute" and I says "All right, sir" and I walked out through t

1 TEXT Daniel Durance Sr.  Dies in His Pew Sunday Morning.  There was a tragic s
2 CONC cene at the M.E. church Sunday morning when an aged worshipper who had hu
2 CONC rried to church to be in time for the opening services, died in the arm
2 CONC s of his daughter just as the last bell tolled its warning notes.  Danie
2 CONC l Durance Sr., who had not been in good health for some time, must have h
2 CONC ad a premonition of the sudden call that came from the further shore, fo
2 CONC r the night before he had begged his daguther, Mrs. J.T. Shrier, to let h
2 CONC im sleep in her bed, and said, "It will be the last time, you can sleep t
2 CONC here after tonight."  And again when morning came, he asked Mrs. Shrier t
2 CONC o go to church with him, "for he wanted to go to church just once more be
2 CONC fore he died."  And as they walked down town, he hurried her along, for
2 CONC , as he said, "I want to get there while the last bell is tolling."  An
2 CONC d it was the last sleep, and the last bell, for "Uncle Durance", as he wa
2 CONC s known about town.  Soon after entering the church, he turned to Mrs. Sh
2 CONC rier, and gasped, "I am fainting," and fell into her arms.  A physician w
2 CONC as in the congregation and immediately rendered what aid was possible, bu
2 CONC t it was unavailing, for the worshipper had gone to the great shrine beyo
2 CONC nd.  The body was carried tenderly from the church and taken home in a ca
2 CONC rriage, and the sudden severing of life's chord in the presence of the ga
2 CONC thered audience, brought forcibly home to all the narrow margin that lie
2 CONC s between all here on earth, and the future beyond the veil.  Daniel Dura
2 CONC nce Sr., was born in England 78 years ago.  He came to Canada when ten ye
2 CONC ars of age, where he was married, and resided until 22 years ago, when h
2 CONC e came to Charlevoix.  His farm near St. Catherines was one of the firs
2 CONC t on which oil was found, and the discovery made him wealthy, but his ric
2 CONC hes did not last very long, it being a case of easy come, and easy go.  H
2 CONC e had made his home with his son, Daniel Durance Jr., up to a short tim
2 CONC e ago, when he went to live with his daughter, Mrs. J.T. Shrier, in whos
2 CONC e arms he died.  He had several children living- Daniel Jr., Jonas and Ge
2 CONC orge Durance, Mrs. Shrier, and Mrs. John Marshall, residing here, his son
2 CONC s William at Mancelong, Edward, at Point Edwards, Ont., and daughters Liz
2 CONC zie at Williamston, Ont., Hannah at Portland, Or., and Mrs. Wm. Erwin a
2 CONC t Clare, Mich.  The funeral was held yesterday from the M.E. church, wher
2 CONC e he was a regular attendant, and where his spirit took its flight for th
2 CONC e further shore.  Death was due to heart failure, and Mr. Durance's fathe
2 CONC r died suddenly, in much the same manner, and from the same cause.

1 TEXT Fare Thee Well, Johnson The Jeweler:  Some die young; some later; some pa
2 CONC ss suddenly while others linger on this side of the border.  But someho
2 CONC w it seems that these things are not so important as the kind of memory w
2 CONC e leave behind.  Some have lived sensationally, some quietly.  Some hav
2 CONC e gained wealth or distinction.  Some leave as their most precious herita
2 CONC ge a reputation for decency, fairness, honesty and friendliness.  And tha
2 CONC t is how Rainier feels toward Sylvester H. Johnson, or as he probably wou
2 CONC ld prefer to be called now, as before, "Johnson the Jeweler."  Mr. Johnso
2 CONC n had so managed his work and his business that he lived comfortably an
2 CONC d with his share of the luxuries that the times afforded; yet on or les
2 CONC s scanty acquaintance the writer of this column built up a feeling that h
2 CONC ere is a man of highest principles, one to whom meanness, shiftiness an
2 CONC d trickiness would be foreign.  Now that death suddenly took him away for
2 CONC m (sp) his work, his shop and his friends, we find everyone reacting tha
2 CONC t Rainier has lost one of it's best men.  We feel sure everyone joins u
2 CONC s in the final greeting.  "Fare Thee Well, Johnson the Jeweler."

1 TEXT The funeral of S.H. Johnson, who died Thursday afternoon, July 10, of a
2 CONC n accidentally inflicted gunshot wound, was held at the Rogers chapel i
2 CONC n St. Helens Sunday after noon with Rev. D.A. Cohagen of St. Helens leadi
2 CONC ng the service and Rev. O. M. Whitman of the Rainier Methodist communit
2 CONC y church assisting.  Burial followed in the Yankton cemetery.  The deceas
2 CONC ed, son of a Baptist minister, and himself intensely interested in churc
2 CONC h work, had talked often with his minister acquaintances, and a few day
2 CONC s before the fatal accident had told Mr. Cohagen that when the time cam
2 CONC e for his funeral, he hoped that it would be an occasion for magnifying C
2 CONC hrist.  The theme of the funeral oration, thus, was "the Christ of Eterni
2 CONC ty," with Mr. Cohagen speaking at length on the Christ, who, existing bey
2 CONC ond the limits of time, had come to the earth on a saving mission, and wh
2 CONC o would conquer all enemies of man, the final conquest being that of deat
2 CONC h itself.  A great many friends of the deceased appeared at the last rite
2 CONC s, the group outside the chapel outnumbering those who could be seated wi
2 CONC thin.  Many beautiful flowers were sent in memory of the deceased.  Mr. J
2 CONC ohnson was born September 25, 1888, at Ford Land, Missouri.  He had bee
2 CONC n a resident of Oregon for the past 24 years and of Prescott for 18 years
2 CONC , be-employed (?) nights as engineer at the Clark & Wilson mill and durin
2 CONC g a portion of the day conducting a jewelry business in Rainier.  Mr. Joh
2 CONC nson and Viola May Singer were married at Galloway, Missouri, September 2
2 CONC 9, 1901.  They reared a family consisting of three sons and two daughters
2 CONC .  The widow and these survive:  Reuben Johnson of Olympia, Washington; D
2 CONC wight Johnosn (sp) and Ivan Johnson of Prescott, Mrs. Ed. Marshall of th
2 CONC e Neer City community and Mrs. George Reese of Prescott.  Also survivin
2 CONC g are Mr. Johnson's 85 year-old father, Rev. W. J. Johnson of St. Helens
2 CONC ; a brother Lawrence Johnosn (sp) of Fairbanks, Alaska; another brother
2 CONC , E. O. Johnson of St. Helens, and a sister, Mrs. Thomas Beecham of Eugne
2 CONC .  (sp)  The accident that caused Mr. Johnson's death came at the end o
2 CONC f his business day last Thursday.  He was in the habit of closing his jew
2 CONC elry shop around 4 p.m. each day, then going to his home for a period o
2 CONC f rest before starting his night's work at the mill.  Since the buildin
2 CONC g occupied by the jewelry business was not of the fire-proof type, Mr. Jo
2 CONC hnson had followed the plan of carrying his most valuable jewelry to hi
2 CONC s home, and had been carrying a gun on these trips.  It is thought that h
2 CONC e dropped the gun while loading a sack of jewelry.  The impact of the fal
2 CONC l discharged the automatic pistol and the bullet struck Mr. Johnson in th
2 CONC e chin.  It followed the chin around the right side, severed the jugula
2 CONC r vein and lodged in the rear of the neck.   Mr. Johnson walked outside t
2 CONC he shop and called attention to his plight by tapping on the window of Th
2 CONC e Topper.  Leonard Magnuson and Fred McKinley, who happened to be in Th
2 CONC e Topper at the time, responded and gave what help they could.  No physic
2 CONC ian was available and an ambulance was called from Longview.  This too
2 CONC k a half hour to arrive, and during this time the victim had become uncon
2 CONC scious and had lost so much blood that life appeared almost extinct.  Th
2 CONC e end came on the Longview bridge enroute to a hospital.  The body was fi
2 CONC rst taken in charge by a Longview undertaker, and later removed to St. He
2 CONC lens, where the father and a brother desided.  (sp)

2 CONT Last Saturday morning Mrs. C.E. Searl received a telegram from the superi
2 CONC ntendent of the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railroad Co., containing the star
2 CONC tling information that her son Edward had been killed that morning in th
2 CONC e yards at Joliet.  Further particulars were not given.
2 CONT Mr. Searl the father, was absent on a trip through the camps, and some di
2 CONC fficulty was experienced in forwarding the sad intelligence to him.
2 CONT The young man so suddenly called was the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. C.E
2 CONC . Searl, and was born at Wautoma,  Feb 2d, 1877.  While still a boy of 14
2 CONC , he formed a desire to work on the railroad, and began the vocation in t
2 CONC he yards here that he followed upon and eventually proved the cause of hi
2 CONC s seemingly untimely death.  For the past ten years or more, he has bee
2 CONC n employed on different roads in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.  He is survi
2 CONC ved by his wife and five children, besides his parents, one sister Ethe
2 CONC l of this city, and three brothers, Harl of Stillwater,  Minn., Arthur o
2 CONC f Black River Falls, and Nile, the youngest, who is at home.
2 CONT It is a sorrow burdened shock that comes to the Searl home, carrying wit
2 CONC h it a heart-felt grief that cannot be realized by other than those who h
2 CONC ave passed through a like ordeal, and while sympathy public and personal
2 CONC , is but a poor balm for the deep-seated wounds, such as it is, it goes o
2 CONC ut to the Searl family in all fervency from every one, and bids them be p
2 CONC atient and bear bravely the cross of sorrow, and the loss of their firs
2 CONC t born.  Words fail in times like these, for only the silent language o
2 CONC f the heart in sorrow's tension, quivering and sob-checked can fully unde
2 CONC rstand.
2 CONT The body arrived in this city from Joliet, on Monday, and the funeral ser
2 CONC vices were held at the Methodist church this afternoon, Rev. Joseph Lucco
2 CONC ck conducting the services.

2 CONT Charles E Searl, good friend, good citizen and a pioneer resident of thi

2 CONC ile citizens, one of her staunchest supporters.
2 CONT Seriously ill for many months, he never lost his cheerful, patient attitu
2 CONC de toward life but at 8:35 o'clock Monday morning the tired eyes closed f
2 CONC or the last time and the harassed spirit was freed of it's pain and suffe
2 CONC ring.
2 CONT Mr. Searl had been ill for a long time, and after disposing of his jewelr
2 CONC y business in this city, the family moved on a farm near Tomahawk in th
2 CONC e hope that the change would help the sick man.  About a year ago they re
2 CONC turned to Merrill and four weeks ago Mr. Searl suffered a stroke of paral
2 CONC ysis, since which time he has grown gradually weaker until the end came.
2 CONT Charles Emmett Searl was the son of Mr. and Mrs. J.K. Searl, and was bor
2 CONC n in Grand Rapids, March 14th, 1851.  In 1879 he came to Merrill, then Je
2 CONC nny, and opened a jewelry store, a store that was well and favorably know
2 CONC n to many people here and hereabouts for many years.
2 CONT Four years before coming to Merrill, Mrs. Searl was married to Miss Emm
2 CONC a Bean, six children being born to them.  Two of them, Edward and Glen, h
2 CONC ave died.  Surviving are the widow, Miss Ethel and Nile Searl, all of thi

2 CONC urviving are four sisters: Mrs. W.N. Hayes of Oxford, Wis, Mrs. C.L. Stow
2 CONC ell of Bass Lake, Mrs. J.E. McGinty of Boulder, Col, and Mrs. Wm. Hoffma
2 CONC n of Cleveland, Ohio, and one brother, E.E. Searl of this city.
2 CONT Mr. Searl was an Oddfellow, a member of the Rebekah lodge, and also the W
2 CONC oodman, having been Clerk of the latter order for many years.
2 CONT The last sad rites were said over the remains yesterday afternoon by Rev
2 CONC . John Wier, at 2:15 o'clock from the home on East Main strees, and at 2:
2 CONC 30 from the Methodist Episcopal church.
2 CONT Although his death causes an aching void in the hearts of his loved ones
2 CONC , his life has been a long and useful one, and they may be consoled by th
2 CONC e fact that his last days were made as easy and happy as loving hands an
2 CONC d care could make them.

2 CONT The following is an extract from a letter dated Mt. Sterling, Ky., Oct. 2
2 CONC 5th, and addressed to Mr. Franklin Bridges, of this county, by his brothe
2 CONC r:
2 CONT "Excitement is very high in Kentucky at this time.  There is from 70,00
2 CONC 0 to 80,000 Southern troops in Kentucky, and from 50,000 to 60,000 Federa
2 CONC ls - and the latter are pouring in every day from Indiana, Ohio, and Illi
2 CONC nois.-  I think we will have some big fighting in Kentucky before long
2 CONC .  It has been reported here, for two or three days, that the Southern tr
2 CONC oops (about 8,000 strong, headed by Zollieoffer,) have whipped out the Fe
2 CONC derals, near Cumberland Gap, and killed quite a number of them.  But it i
2 CONC s a hard matter to get anything here that is reliable - for the Governmen
2 CONC t has suppressed every Southern Rights paper of any note in the State, an
2 CONC d the other papers dare not publish anything favorable to the South.  Th
2 CONC e Union men here do not seem to watn to fight, as volunteering goes on qu
2 CONC ite slow, and with a heavy drag.  The leaders are making speeches, and of
2 CONC fering them every inducement they can - but all to but little purpose; wh
2 CONC ile the young men who are for Southern Rights are volunteering by thousan
2 CONC ds.  They leave in the night - for if they were to leave in the daytime
2 CONC , they would be taken up- they have been leaving by tens and twenties, an
2 CONC d hundreds.  They travel by night and hide in some thick woods in the day
2 CONC , until they can reach some Southern camp.
2 CONT The Southern tropps are all in the southern part of the State except abou
2 CONC t 8,000 under Colonel John S. Williams in Pike and Morgan counties, who w
2 CONC ent from this and adjoining counties.  David Wallin left here some five w
2 CONC eeks ago with about 40 as good fellows as you ever saw and is now with Zo
2 CONC llieoffer near Cumberland Gap.  A Southern rights man cannot buy a poun
2 CONC d of powder here now without getting a permit from some Union man appoint
2 CONC ed for that purpose.  There has been a great many areests made in the Sta
2 CONC te but not many about here.  They have been talking about taking me up bu
2 CONC t have not troubled me as yet, and I do not think they will, though man
2 CONC y men have fled to the mountains to keep from being arrested.  It is ofte
2 CONC n the case here that a man will be for the union and all his sons for sou
2 CONC thern rights; sometimes half the boys will be one way and half the other
2 CONC .  There have been many changes here since the election in favor of the S
2 CONC outh.  There will be a desperate struggle between North and South about w
2 CONC ho shall have Kentucky; but I think the South will get her.

2 CONT With Winthrop's fleet, early in 1630, came to the New World one whose des
2 CONC cendants were destined to play a not unimportant part in the affairs of t
2 CONC he coming nation.  His name was Jehue Burr.  He was the first of his rac
2 CONC e in America, so far as we have any record, and soon after his arrival se
2 CONC ttled in Roxbury, Mass.  He was admitted a freeman in 1632.  In 1635 bot
2 CONC h himself and wife appear as members of the church of Roxbury.  About th
2 CONC e same time he received his first appointment in the colony as overseer o
2 CONC f roads and bridges between Boston and Roxbury.  At a General Court of th
2 CONC e Massachusetts Bay Colony, held at Boston, Aug 6, 1635, "Mr. Tresur" (Tr
2 CONC easure, an official title) Jehue Burre and John Johnson were appointe
2 CONC d a committee for "Rocksbury" and a like number of men for Boston "in th
2 CONC e making of a cart-bridge over Muddy River, and over Stony River at the c
2 CONC harge of Boston and Rocksbury."
2 CONT His name also appears in the records of a General Court held at Newtown
2 CONC , March 1, 1635, as follows: "The difference betwixt Mr. Dumer and Jehu
2 CONC e Burre, aboute Mr. Dumer's swine spoyling his corne, is by their consen
2 CONC t referred to the final determination of Wm. Parke, Goodman Potter, and G

2 CONT No further mention is made of him in the Massachusetts Records.
2 CONT He did not, however, long remain a resident of Roxbury.  There, Opportuni
2 CONC ties for rising in the world were far too limited to suit one of his ente
